#  Space Marine Junaid

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/space-marine-junaid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nightblade9/space-marine-junaid)

Metroid-inspired roguelike made in ReactJS. 

# Notes

- Prototype #1 checks performance with raw JS and the DOM. Renders 40x22 at ~6FPS on my dev machine.
  - Adding colour or changing the font size used doesn't change the FPS
  - Making the number of things we're rendering more/less drastically impacts the FPS.
